# Software Compliance 
Software compliance encompasses various areas that software can be evaluated and governed against, depending on its intended use, industry, and geographical location. Here's a broad categorization of different types of software compliance:

## Licensing Compliance:
- Ensures software is used according to the terms of its licensing agreement.
- Prevents the use of pirated software or exceeding licensed user counts.


## Data Protection and Privacy:

- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Applies to organizations in the EU or those dealing with EU residents' data.
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA): Relevant for businesses serving California residents.
- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): Pertains to software handling health information in the U.S.
- Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA): Governs software dealing with student education records.


## Accessibility Compliance:

- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG): Ensures web applications and websites are accessible to people with disabilities.
- Section 508: U.S. federal law mandating that all electronic and information technology developed, procured, maintained, or used by the federal government be accessible to people with disabilities.

## Security Compliance:

- Ensures software is developed, maintained, and operated securely.
- May relate to standards like ISO 27001 or best practices like the OWASP Top Ten.


## Environmental Compliance:

## Operational Compliance:

- Compliance with internal standards, architectures, or best practices.
- Often defined within large organizations or those with specific operational needs.


## Ethical Compliance:
